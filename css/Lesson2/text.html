            In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE,
            a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989,
            Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.
            Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990.
            That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated
            on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN.
            In his personal notes[4] from 1990 he listed[5] "some of the many areas in which hypertext
            is used" and put an encyclopedia first.
